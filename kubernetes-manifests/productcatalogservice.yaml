# This file should be applied only after replacing INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME with
# the product catalog SQL database instance name, taken from
# `gcloud sql instances describe`. For example,
# sed s/INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME/$(gcloud sql instance describe mysql-instance \
#   | grep connectionName: | awk '{ print $2}')/ | kubectl apply -f -
#
# This also uses the productcatalog-sql service account via workload identity to
# connect to the Cloud SQL instance. A project role binding to cloudsql.client
# should be made on this account in order to access the CloudSQL instance, a
# service-account role binding to iam.workloadIdentityUser should be made to the
# project svc.id.goog account, and a similarly named kubernetes service account
# should be created and annotated with
# iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account=productcatalog-sql@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com.
